This week, I started working on the JavaScript for my quiz and of course just some basic HTML. I did not complete the JavaScript because I do not have a working quiz at the moment. I think I have a good start, but I ran into a few snags and need some help and advice to make it work like the quiz I envisioned. I used this tutorial https://codepen.io/jannypie/pen/DcHdo/. I also need help with the part of the JavaScript that "scores" the quiz. I knew this would be challenging, so I am okay with where I am right now but I have to get over a few humps.
