Week 1


This week, I started working on the JavaScript for my quiz and of course just some basic HTML. I did not complete the JavaScript because I do not have a working quiz at the moment. I think I have a good start, but I ran into a few snags and need some help and advice to make it work like the quiz I envisioned. I used this tutorial https://codepen.io/jannypie/pen/DcHdo/. I also need help with the part of the JavaScript that "scores" the quiz. I knew this would be challenging, so I am okay with where I am right now but I have to get over a few humps.

Week 2

I made great progress this week, especially compared to last week. First, I finished the JavaScript for the quiz using this extremely helpful resource: https://www.dragonflycave.com/free-quiz-scripts. It took  a lot of work but I figured it out, which was rewarding. Then, I started writing the HTML and JavaScript/jQuery for the flipping animation. I used this resource for help: https://nnattawat.github.io/flip/. I also started learning how to use grid to help with the layout of the flipping cards. It worked but I bet it could be better written. I also made all of the front images for the flipping cards and filled in the text information for the back of the cards. All of the website is still ugly, but I will fix that next week when I write the CSS, which I feel confident making.


Week 3
This week I fixed the way my grid worked. Now it is much easier to use and understand than the way I had it last week. I did a lot of work to make the page look nicer, including fonts and background colors. I added the introductory information and the opening image for the website that says Feel the Connection.

I have a little work left to do, as I have run into a few snags. First, I want the boxes to span across the whole page. For some reason there is a little bit of a bar between the end of the screen and the beginning and end of my divs. I also need to make it so that the li in my header and in the provider information does not have the green box around it. I tried using the header > li, but that didn't work. I also need to make it so that the box in the quiz changes color so the user knows they clicked it and the information was recorded. I also want to make the results look more interesting when they appear. Overall, I think I can work this out by Monday so I can upload to the site.
