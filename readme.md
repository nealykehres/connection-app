Week 1


This week, I started working on the JavaScript for my quiz and of course just some basic HTML. I did not complete the JavaScript because I do not have a working quiz at the moment. I think I have a good start, but I ran into a few snags and need some help and advice to make it work like the quiz I envisioned. I used this tutorial https://codepen.io/jannypie/pen/DcHdo/. I also need help with the part of the JavaScript that "scores" the quiz. I knew this would be challenging, so I am okay with where I am right now but I have to get over a few humps.

Week 2

I made great progress this week, especially compared to last week. First, I finished the JavaScript for the quiz using this extremely helpful resource: https://www.dragonflycave.com/free-quiz-scripts. It took  a lot of work but I figured it out, which was rewarding. Then, I started writing the HTML and JavaScript/jQuery for the flipping animation. I used this resource for help: https://nnattawat.github.io/flip/. I also started learning how to use grid to help with the layout of the flipping cards. It worked but I bet it could be better written. I also made all of the front images for the flipping cards and filled in the text information for the back of the cards. All of the website is still ugly, but I will fix that next week when I write the CSS, which I feel confident making.
